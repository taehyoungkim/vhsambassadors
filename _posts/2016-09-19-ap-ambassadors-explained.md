With the program being reworked into the academic norms of Vandegrift High School, the question is becoming more and more prevalent: what is an AP Ambassador?

It's simple enough, really– an AP Ambassador is a selected student from the AP Program at VHS who wishes to mentor, tutor, and help students entering Vandegrift's academic environment.  Having had  AP teachers at Vandegrift nominate their most worthy candidates, the AP Ambassadors are a select few of intelligent and helpful students that want to ease the transition and endurance of high school for any student who asks, in any way they need.


First and foremost is the mentoring of our fellow students.  As AP Ambassadors, we all have already experienced the rigor of the Advanced Placement Program at VHS, and have succeeded to the point of recommendation by those who taught them.  The Ambassadors understand the stress of schoolwork, and are there to help a student of any grade and any level to organize and divide their workload best.  Trust me– we know how hard it is to balance six or more academic classes at once, and we know that sorting time for each subject is a pain, so we're here to give tips and help you find a system of success that fits you best.


Another benefit to the AP Ambassador program is tutoring by a student strong in any subject.  Each AP Ambassador chooses their specialty to tailor their strengths to the needs of students at Vandegrift, and we dedicate our time during PIT to providing help on topics and concepts you may be struggling with.  Each of our AP Ambassador's strong suits vary– so there's a tutor for everyone! (We even will have SAT tutors, if you didn't make the cutoff for PSAT Team!)


Lastly, AP Ambassadors just want to be there for any student who is struggling to decide what courses to take, whether or not they want to take a certain level of a course, or what their parents are expecting of them in an unusually difficult course.  From student to student, we give our own experiences to help you better determine what will work best for you, and we also happily speak to parents on AP Program Parent Nights to represent the program as a whole. 


Overall, the AP Ambassador Program is aimed at helping you, no matter what your need may be– advice, tutoring/lessons, study tips, etc.  We hope to hear from you soon!
